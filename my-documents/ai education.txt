1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors,
and education is no exception. AI plays a significant role in both general and higher educa
tion, influencing students’ academic development by offering a mix of opportunities and
challenges (Edtech, 2020). From personalized learning experiences to intelligent tutoring
systems that provide tailored guidance, support, and feedback based on individual learning
patterns and knowledge levels (Hwang et al., 2020), AI has the potential to revolution
ize education (Holmes et al., 2019) and address the diverse needs of learners. However,
positive educational outcomes are not guaranteed solely by the adoption of advanced AI

technologies (Castaneda & Selwyn, 2018; Du Boulay, 2000; Selwyn, 2016). The integration
of AI in academic environments raises critical questions related to equity, accessibility,
and the evolving role of traditional teaching methods. The influence of AI on education
is transformative and multifaceted. AI enables personalized learning by adapting educa
tional content to meet the unique needs of individual students (Hennekeuser et al., 2024).
Studies have shown that students in personalized learning environments exhibit improved
self-efficacy and a more positive attitude toward their education (Johnson & Smith, 2019).
These experiences are increasingly achievable through AI-driven tools that analyze vast
amounts of data to identify learning gaps and tailor interventions accordingly (J. A. Baker,
2021). For instance, AI-powered platforms, such as adaptive learning systems, have been
shown to enhance student engagement and performance by providing real-time feedback
and customized learning pathways (Luckin et al., 2016; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019).
In traditional education, students are encouraged to take an active role in their learning
process by developing skills in exploration, analysis, and problem solving. Critical thinking
skills are essential for shaping students’ overall learning experiences. Educators often rely
on questioning techniques, collaborative activities, and assignments to enhance students’
ability to evaluate information and develop independent perspectives (Facione, 2020).
However, the rapid information processing and insightful responses provided by AI
challenge traditional learning methods, raising questions about the distinctions between
human learning and machine-based learning. For example, while AI can efficiently process
and analyze data, it may lack the nuanced understanding and creativity inherent in human
cognition (Luckin et al., 2016). This underscores the need for a balanced approach to AI
integration, ensuring that it complements rather than replaces human interaction and the
development of critical thinking skills (Wu, 2023).
The use of AI in education is not without its challenges. The effective integration of
artificial intelligence in education requires a thorough understanding of both the technology
and the learning process. This complexity is further heightened by ethical concerns, espe
cially in the context of the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence. For instance,
Qadir (2023) highlights the risk of students misusing AI tools in dishonest or unautho
rized ways, such as using AI-generated content to complete assignments without proper
attribution. Additionally, concerns about the application of AI in surveillance, control,
and assessment practices could undermine trust and autonomy in educational settings
(Williamson, 2017). Higher education institutions must clearly define the role and extent of
AI in student education to address these challenges effectively (Holmes & Tuomi, 2022).
As data processing and computing technologies have evolved, artificial intelligence
(AI) has been increasingly applied in the educational field, often referred to as Artifi
cial Intelligence in Education (AIED). Applications such as intelligent tutoring systems,
educational robots, learning analytics dashboards, adaptive learning platforms, andhuman
computer interactions have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing teaching and
learning (Chen et al., 2020; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). For example, intelligent tutoring
systems have been shown to provide personalized feedback and support, improving stu
dent engagement and learning outcomes (Luckin et al., 2016). Similarly, adaptive learning
platforms leverage AI to tailor educational content to individual learners’ needs, promoting
more effective and efficient learning experiences (Holmes et al., 2019).
Despite advancements, AI integration in education raises critical questions about its
alignment with established learning theories. While studies have explored challenges
(Hwang et al., 2020), obstacles (T. Baker et al., 2019), and future perspectives (Pinkwart,
2016), few explicitly analyze AI’ s diverse functions and their relationship with pedagogical
frameworks. For instance, how do AI tools align with constructivist or socio-cultural
theories emphasizing collaboration, context, and critical thinking (Luckin et al., 2016)
Educ. Sci. 2025, 15, 343

Additionally, the long-term impact of AI on teaching, learning, and educational equity
remains underexplored (Selwyn, 2022).
Akeychallenge is ensuring AI complements, rather than replaces, human interaction.
While AI automates tasks and provides data-driven insights, it lacks the empathy, creativity,
and nuanced understanding of human educators (Holmes & Tuomi, 2022). Over-reliance
on AI for assessment and feedback may reduce opportunities for meaningful dialogue and
reflection, essential for higher-order thinking (Facione, 2020). Ethical concerns, such as data
privacy, algorithmic bias, and the digital divide, must also be addressed to ensure equitable
and inclusive learning environments (O’Neil, 2016).
AI holds immense potential to transform education through personalized learning
and adaptive systems. However, its integration requires caution. A deeper understanding
of AI’ s interplay with educational theories, alongside addressing ethical and pedagogical
challenges, is essential. A balanced, human-centered approach prioritizing equitable access
can ensure AI empowers rather than excludes.
This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the
learning processes and academic performance of students at the National University of
Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest. Specifically, our research aims to
explore the types of AI technologies utilized, the frequency of their use, and students’
perceptions regarding their effectiveness in improving academic performance. Additionally,
this study investigates the concerns and challenges associated with the integration of AI
in education.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Sample
The sample consisted of 85 second-year students, purposefully selected from the
Aerospace and Medical Engineering programs, which emphasize AI integration. A pur
posive, non-probabilistic sampling method was employed to ensure the selection of par
ticipants with direct experience in AI-integrated learning environments, thus enhancing
the relevance of the findings. Second-year students were chosen due to their foundational
knowledge and early exposure to advanced technologies, such as AI.
This approach allowed for a focused examination of individuals who had direct
exposure to the technologies central to the study. Given the small sample size and its
focus on specific academic programs, the findings should be considered preliminary and
exploratory. They cannot be generalized to all students within these programs or to those
in other fields. Future research with a larger, more diverse sample is needed to provide
more robust insights.
2.2. Data Collection and Research Instrument
Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire distributed via Google
Forms. This platform was chosen for its user-friendly interface and integrated analytical
tools, which facilitated efficient data management and interpretation. The study utilized
a mixed-methods design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data collection
techniques. The questionnaire consisted of 11 items, categorized into two types of questions
as follows; 7 closed-ended questions designed to quantify students’ responses and identify
patterns, and 4 open-ended questions aimed at capturing detailed qualitative insights into
participants’ experiences, perceptions, and expectations regarding the impact of AI on their
learning. The closed-ended questions were further divided as follows yesno questions
(Items 1, 4, and 6), multiple-choice questions (Items 2 and 7), and Likert scale questions
(Items 3 and 5), enabling both categorical and ordinal data analysis.
Educ. Sci. 2025, 15, 343

2.3. Analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, including
frequency and percentage calculations, to provide a clear overview of students’ percep
tions, usage patterns, and the perceived effectiveness of AI tools. For the qualitative data,
responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis, a well
established and rigorous method for interpreting qualitative data. The thematic analysis
followed the framework proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006), ensuring a systematic and
transparent approach to identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within
the data.
The analysis was conducted at two levels as follows vertical analysis, which focused
on individual responses to identify unique insights; and horizontal analysis, which ex
amined patterns across the entire dataset to ensure a comprehensive understanding of
emerging themes. To enhance the validity and reliability of the findings, the analysis
adhered to a structured, iterative process, as outlined by Ezzy (2002). This process included
the following transcription of participants’ responses, creation of a coding scheme; de
velopment of an analysis grid; analysis of transcripts and thematic interpretation; and
calculation of statistical indicators. To further strengthen the validity of the results, data
triangulation was employed. Responses from students in the Aerospace and Medical
Engineering programs were compared to identify potential program-specific trends and
to validate the consistency of the identified themes across different student populations.
This mixed-methods approach, integrating both qualitative and quantitative analysis, pro
vided a rich and nuanced understanding of students’ perceptions of AI in education, while
ensuring the reliability, depth, and generalizability of the findings.
3. Results
Thedatainterpretation involved addressing each research question both quantitatively,
by calculating frequencies within specific thematic categories; and qualitatively, through
the statistical analysis of the participants’ responses.
According to the statistical data obtained, 95.6% of respondents use artificial intelli
gence technologies in academic activities. This high percentage suggests the widespread
adoption of AI tools among students, reflecting the increasing integration of advanced
technologies into the educational landscape.
Regarding the main types of AI used in academic activities, 88.2% of respondents
use virtual assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Siri, Google Assistant, etc.), 42.4% of respondents
use AI-based educational platforms (e.g., Coursera, Duolingo, etc.), 17.6% of respondents
use automatic content generation tools, 8.2% of respondents use data processing tools
(e.g., predictive analysis), while 3.5% of respondents use other types of AI. For the data
analysis, frequency analysis and percentage calculations were applied. These descriptive
techniques allowed for the determination of the distribution of responses across each AI
usage category. Percentages were calculated by relating the number of responses for each
category to the total number of participants (100% of responses), providing a clear picture
of the prevalence of each AI usage option. Frequency analysis was essential in identifying
general trends and understanding which technologies are the most and least popular in
the academic environment. The results of the analysis suggest that AI usage in academia
is already a well-established practice, with a clear preference for virtual assistants and
AI-based educational platforms. This reflects a global trend towards the integration of
interactive and accessible technologies in the educational process. Virtual assistants, being
easy to use and accessible for a wide range of academic tasks, are by far the most popular.
Additionally, AI-assisted educational platforms provide a personalized learning experience,
which contributes to their frequent use.
Educ. Sci. 2025, 15, 343

Furthermore, we set out to investigate the frequency of artificial intelligence tool
usage in academic activities. The results show significant variation among students, with
data indicating the widespread adoption of these technologies. Most students (57.6%) use
them weekly, suggesting that these tools have become an integral part of the educational
process, assisting with homework, projects, and knowledge enhancement. A considerable
percentage, 18.8%, use AI daily, indicating a higher reliance on these technologies, possibly
because they consider them essential for learning—whether through virtual assistants,
educational platforms, or other AI-based tools. On the other hand, 11.8% of students use
AI monthly, which may suggest occasional use depending on academic needs, while a
similar percentage (11.8%) uses them rarely, indicating limited adoption or a preference for
traditional learning methods. Only 1.2% of students stated that they do not use AI tools at
all, confirming that AI has become an almost indispensable resource in education.
We also wanted to investigate students’ perception of the impact of artificial intel
ligence (AI) use in their learning process. The results showed a significant majority of
students believe AI is helpful in their academic activities. Thus, 80% of them agree that
using AI-based technologies enhances their educational experience, either by optimizing
the time spent studying or by providing quick access to personalized educational resources
that facilitate their understanding of complex materials. However, 17.6% of students ex
pressed uncertainty about the effects of AI on their learning, which may suggest either
limited use or a lack of familiarity with the potential of these tools. This group may include
students who have not explored all the options AI offers in detail or those who are not
yet convinced of the effectiveness of these technologies. In contrast, only 2.4% of students
considered AI to be of no benefit to their educational process. These students might prefer
traditional learning methods or may face difficulties in using these technologies, limiting
their understanding of AI’ s potential in supporting their studies.
Regarding the impact of AI usage on academic performance in exams, projects, and
grades, many students believe that AI plays a positive role in improving their results.
Specifically, 82.4% of students think that using AI contributes to enhancing their academic
performance. However, some (15.3%) believe that implementing AI does not bring sig
nificant changes in this regard, and 3.5% feel that it only limits knowledge acquisition.
Additionally, only 2.4% of students think that using AI could lead to a decline in academic
performance, suggesting that there are also critical voices regarding the long-term effects of
this technology on the educational process.
Wealso wanted to investigate to what extent students believe that the use of artificial
intelligence (AI) contributes to their efficiency in the learning process, considering aspects
such as saving time or quick access to relevant information. The results show that most
students (83.5%) believe that AI improves their learning efficiency by facilitating quick
access to educational resources, reducing the time needed to find information, and helping
them organize their academic activities better. On the other hand, 10.6% of students do
not think that using AI increases their learning efficiency, which may suggest a different
perception of the utility of these technologies or a lack of familiarity with their potential.
Additionally, 7.1% of students stated that they are unsure about AI’ s impact on their
learning efficiency, which could reflect less frequent use or uncertainty about how these
tools can support their learning. Most students recognize the benefits of AI in enhancing
learning efficiency; however, there is still a portion of them who are not convinced by its
effects, highlighting the need for the better understanding and use of these technologies.
Whenit comes to the main concerns students have about using artificial intelligence
in education, the most significant issue is the possibility of receiving incorrect or imprecise
answers, with 48.2% of students expressing this concern. This is closely followed by worries
about the negative impact on critical thinking (16.5%) and the risk of becoming overly
Educ. Sci. 2025, 15, 343
6 of 12
dependent on technology (16.5%). Other concerns, though less common, include data
privacy issues (9.4%), the fear that the results generated by AI may not truly belong to the
student (3.5%), and a category labeled as “other” (5.9%). These concerns reflect a strong
awareness among students of both the potential benefits and drawbacks of AI in education,
particularly in relation to the accuracy of AI-generated content and its possible effects on
their cognitive abilities and autonomy.
For the item “What suggestions do you have for improving the use of AI in edu
cation to more effectively support the learning process”, we applied thematic analysis
to identify recurring patterns in student responses. This analysis followed a systematic
process to ensure validity and reliability in capturing key themes. The following four our

To strengthen the validity and reliability of our findings, we employed data triangu
lation by comparing responses across different academic programs, namely Aerospace
and Medical Engineering students. This allowed us to identify program-specific trends or
concerns and cross-verify the consistency of the themes across different student popula
tions. Triangulation further supported the robustness of our findings by ensuring that the
identified themes held true across diverse student groups. The findings indicate that while
students recognize the potential of AI to improve learning, they also have concerns and
suggestions for optimizing its use in education. Overall, students advocate for a thought
ful and responsible approach to AI integration, emphasizing its potential to enhance the

in education.
4. Discussion
This article analyzes the impact of AI technologies on students’ learning processes
and academic performance, focusing on their perceptions and the challenges associated
with AI integration in education.
The results show that 95.6% of respondents use AI in their academic activities, under
scoring the deep integration of this technology into modern education. Virtual assistants
are the most used AI applications (88.2%), providing support for information retrieval, task
management, and real-time feedback. Additionally, 42.4% of respondents use AI-based ed
ucational platforms, reflecting a shift toward personalized and interactive learning. Virtual
assistants help students access relevant information quickly, organize tasks, and receive
instant feedback, thereby enhancing efficiency and engagement in the educational process.
The thematic analysis of open-ended responses reveals AI has a dual impact. On the
one hand, students support its integration to complement traditional teaching methods;
Educ. Sci. 2025, 15, 343
10 of 12
on the other, some members of the academic community call for balanced regulations and
more robust validation protocols. Triangulating data from various academic programs,
such as Aerospace Engineering and Medical Engineering, confirms the consistency of these
concerns, strengthening the reliability of our conclusions.
Based on this study, we conclude that AI offers significant benefits, such as per
sonalized learning, improved educational outcomes, and increased student engagement.
However, it also presents challenges, such as over-reliance on technology, diminished
critical thinking, and the risk of academic fraud. Educational institutions must adopt
data protection measures and prevent bias, carefully weighing the pros and cons of AI
implementation. These findings align with previous research showing that AI can adapt
educational content to students’ individual needs, optimizing study time and enhancing
academic performance (Krause et al., 2024).
Our study also highlights some notable concerns as follows nearly half of the respon
dents (48.2%) expressed reservations about the accuracy of AI-generated content, while
others pointed out the risks of technological dependence, which may undermine critical
thinking and human interaction. These concerns are also reflected in the literature. A recent
study has stressed the negative impact of AI on critical thinking and human interaction,
emphasizing the need for validation mechanisms and ethical regulations for technology
use (Ju, 2023). Similarly, Săseanu et al. (2024) recommend control measures to mitigate
the negative effects of AI, and Łodzikowski et al. (2023) emphasize the need for ethical
regulations in AI use in education. The responsible implementation of AI in education can
bring significant benefits, contributing to more adaptable and efficient academic prepara
tion. AI should not replace traditional methods but should complement them, offering a
personalized and optimized learning experience.
Given the small sample size and its focus on specific academic programs, the findings
should be considered preliminary and exploratory. They cannot be generalized to all
students within these programs or to those in other fields. Additionally, the impact of AI
on critical thinking and creativity was not extensively investigated. Future research with
a larger, more diverse sample is needed to provide more robust insights. Such research
could include students from various academic disciplines, years of study, and demographic
backgrounds, offering a more comprehensive understanding of AI’ s impact on students in
different educational contexts.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our research highlights that AI has become a critical component of the
modern academic landscape, offering significant benefits such as personalized learning,
enhanced engagement, and improved access to educational resources. Nevertheless, while
most students view AI positively—citing its capacity to enhance learning efficiency and
academic performance—there remain important challenges, particularly regarding the
accuracy of AI outputs, the risk of over-dependence, and the potential erosion of critical
thinking skills.
To ensure the effective integration of AI in education, we recommend the following
Comprehensive training Institutions should implement training programs for both
educators and students to foster a thorough understanding of AI tools and their proper use.
Clear guidelines and validation protocols Establish robust standards for AI deploy
ment that include the regular validation of AI-generated information and clear guidelines
to prevent over-reliance on technology.
Ethical and privacy considerations Develop and enforce policies to protect student
data and mitigate potential biases in AI systems.

Longitudinal research Future studies should adopt longitudinal designs with larger,
more diverse samples to better understand the long-term effects of AI on academic out
comes and career development.
By addressing these recommendations, educational institutions can ensure that AI
complements rather than replaces traditional teaching methods, ultimately fostering a more
adaptable, efficient, and personalized learning environment that supports the development
of essential skills for future success.
